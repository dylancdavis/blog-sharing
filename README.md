# Overview

This is my blog-sharing application, created using the MERN stack and deployed using fly.io. To interact with the current production version of the site, visit its [fly.io link](https://blog-sharing.fly.dev/)! This will take you to the login page seen below:

Login with these demo credentials to gain access:
  - Username: demo
  - Password: password

Or, feel free to create your own account! However, do NOT use a password you use on other sites! This is a personal project only, and I make no guarantee as to the long-term security of its passwords.
